# Link Lifter

LinkLifter is a Python script that searches for URLs in a given text file or recursively in a directory and its subdirectories. The found URLs, along with the file they are located in, are saved to a CSV file.

## Features

- Search for URLs in a single text file.
- Recursively search for URLs in a directory and its subdirectories.
- Save the found URLs and their file paths to a CSV file named `LinkLifter_<current_date_time>.csv`.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `LinkLifter.py` script.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlteredAdmin/Link-Lifter
    ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The script was developed using Python 3.8, but it should work with other Python 3 versions as well.

## Usage

    ```bash
    cd path/to/script_directory
    ```

2. Run the script using Python:

    ```

3. When prompted, enter the path to the file or directory you want to search.

4. The script will create a CSV file in the current directory with the found URLs and their file paths.
